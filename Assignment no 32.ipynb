    "\n",
    "1. **t-test**:\n",
    "   - A t-test is used when you have a small sample size (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "   - It's also used when the population follows a normal distribution or when the sample size is large and you don't know the population standard deviation.\n",
    "   - A common scenario for using a t-test is in medical trials, where you may have a small sample size of patients and you want to compare the means of two groups (e.g., treatment group vs. control group) to see if there's a significant difference in their outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **z-test**:\n",
    "   - A z-test is used when you have a large sample size (typically more than 30) and the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "   - It's also used when the population follows a normal distribution and the sample size is large.\n",
    "   - An example scenario for using a z-test is in quality control in manufacturing, where you have a large sample size of items and you want to compare the mean of your sample to a known population mean to determine if the manufacturing process is within acceptable limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **t-test example**: Suppose you're testing a new drug to lower blood pressure. You randomly select 20 patients with hypertension and administer the new drug to one group while giving a placebo to another group. After a month, you measure their blood pressure levels and want to determine if there's a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **z-test example**: Let's say you're a manager in a factory producing light bulbs, and the average lifespan of bulbs produced is known to be 1000 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. You randomly select 100 light bulbs from the production line and want to determine if the mean lifespan of the current batch of bulbs differs significantly from the known average of 1000 hours."

    "2. **Two-tailed test**:\n",

    "   - It is used when the interest is in determining whether a sample statistic is significantly different from a certain value, regardless of the direction of the difference.\n",

The null hypothesis (H0) is that the drug has no effect, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the drug is effective.

    "To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the weight loss drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test, we need to set up the null and alternative hypotheses, choose an appropriate significance level, calculate the test statistic, and compare it to the critical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate the hypotheses**:\n",
    "   - Null hypothesis (\\( H_0 \\)): The weight loss drug is not significantly effective. (Mean weight loss = 0)\n",
    "   - Alternative hypothesis (\\( H_1 \\)): The weight loss drug is significantly effective. (Mean weight loss ≠ 0)\n",

    "   - \\( H_0: \\mu = 0 \\)\n",
    "   - \\( H_1: \\mu \\neq 0 \\)\n",

    "2. **Choose the significance level (\\( \\alpha \\))**: We are given a 95% confidence level, so \\( \\alpha = 0.05 \\). This means we'll reject the null hypothesis if the probability of obtaining the observed result (or more extreme) under the null hypothesis is less than 0.05.\n",

    "   With a t-statistic of approximately 16.97 and a p-value much smaller than 0.05, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that the weight loss drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level.
