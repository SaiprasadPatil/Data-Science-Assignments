    "Here's a detailed overview of Lasso Regression and its comparison with other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regularized linear regression technique that adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Cost Function} = \\text{RSS} + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where \\(\\text{RSS}\\) is the residual sum of squares, \\(\\lambda\\) is the regularization parameter, and \\(\\beta_j\\) are the model coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences from Other Regression Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Unlike Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, which does not include a regularization term, Lasso includes an \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty that encourages sparsity in the model coefficients.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection:** Lasso Regression can set some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection, which distinguishes it from Ridge Regression that shrinks coefficients but does not eliminate them.\n",
    "- **Comparison with Ridge Regression:** Lasso uses an \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty, while Ridge uses an \\(\\ell_2\\) penalty. Ridge shrinks coefficients but keeps all features, whereas Lasso can zero out some coefficients, thus selecting a subset of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage in Feature Selection:**\n",
    "- **Sparsity:** Lasso Regression's primary advantage is its ability to perform feature selection by driving some coefficients exactly to zero. This results in a simpler and more interpretable model with fewer features, which can be beneficial for understanding which predictors are most important and for reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting Coefficients:**\n",
    "- **Non-zero Coefficients:** Coefficients that are non-zero indicate the importance of the corresponding features in predicting the target variable. These features are considered relevant in the model.\n",
    "- **Zero Coefficients:** Features with coefficients set to zero are excluded from the model due to their minimal contribution to predicting the target variable. This results from the regularization process of Lasso.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuning Parameters:**\n",
    "- **Regularization Parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)):** The key parameter in Lasso Regression is \\(\\lambda\\), which controls the strength of the regularization:\n",
    "  - **High \\(\\lambda\\):** Increases the penalty on the absolute values of coefficients, leading to more coefficients being set to zero and potentially more features being excluded from the model.\n",
    "  - **Low \\(\\lambda\\):** Reduces the penalty, allowing more coefficients to remain non-zero and thus including more features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effect on Model Performance:**\n",
    "- **Model Complexity:** Higher \\(\\lambda\\) results in a simpler model with fewer features but may lead to underfitting. Lower \\(\\lambda\\) results in a more complex model with potentially better fit but may risk overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application to Non-Linear Problems:**\n",
    "- **Direct Use:** Lasso Regression itself is inherently linear, and applying it directly to non-linear problems may not be effective.\n",
    "- **Extensions:**\n",
    "  - **Polynomial Features:** Non-linear relationships can be modeled by adding polynomial features to the dataset before applying Lasso Regression.\n",
    "  - **Kernel Methods:** For more complex non-linear relationships, kernel methods or other non-linear models can be combined with Lasso to capture non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "- **Penalty Type:**\n",
    "  - **Ridge Regression:** Uses an \\(\\ell_2\\) penalty (\\(\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2\\)), which shrinks coefficients but does not set any to zero.\n",
    "  - **Lasso Regression:** Uses an \\(\\ell_1\\) penalty (\\(\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\\)), which can drive some coefficients to exactly zero, thus performing feature selection.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection:**\n",
    "  - **Ridge:** Keeps all features but shrinks their influence.\n",
    "  - **Lasso:** Can exclude features by setting their coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "- **Effectiveness:** Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity to some extent. The regularization term in Lasso can reduce the magnitude of coefficients of correlated predictors, which helps stabilize the estimates.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection:** By setting some coefficients to zero, Lasso effectively removes some correlated features, which can mitigate multicollinearity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Optimal \\(\\lambda\\):**\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation:** The most common method is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is split into k subsets. The model is trained on \\(k-1\\) subsets and validated on the remaining subset for different values of \\(\\lambda\\). The \\(\\lambda\\) that results in the best performance (lowest validation error) is chosen.\n",
    "- **Grid Search:** Conducting a grid search over a range of \\(\\lambda\\) values and selecting the one that provides the best performance based on cross-validation results.\n",
    "- **Regularization Path Algorithms:** Techniques like coordinate descent or LARS (Least Angle Regression) can efficiently compute the solution path for various values of \\(\\lambda\\).\n",
    "\n",
