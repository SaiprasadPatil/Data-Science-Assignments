    "\n",
    "**Traditional Web Hosting:**\n",
    "- **Infrastructure:** Typically involves hosting your website on a physical server or a virtual private server (VPS) within a data center.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Limited scalability; upgrading requires manual intervention (e.g., upgrading server hardware or moving to a larger VPS).\n",
    "- **Cost:** Often has a fixed cost based on the resources allocated (e.g., storage, bandwidth).\n",
    "- **Maintenance:** The hosting provider handles hardware maintenance, but you may need to manage server configurations and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Hosting:**\n",
    "- **Infrastructure:** Uses a network of virtual servers hosted on a cloud provider’s infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Highly scalable; resources can be dynamically adjusted based on demand (e.g., adding more servers or increasing storage).\n",
    "- **Cost:** Pay-as-you-go model based on usage; you only pay for the resources you use.\n",
    "- **Maintenance:** The cloud provider manages hardware and infrastructure maintenance, while you manage application and service configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How do you choose the right cloud provider for your application deployment, and what factors should you consider?\n",
