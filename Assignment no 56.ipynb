    "### Q1. What is Bayes' Theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It provides a way to calculate the probability of a condition or event occurring, given the probability of another related event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is the Formula for Bayes' Theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is mathematically represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the posterior probability of event \\( A \\) given that \\( B \\) has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the likelihood of event \\( B \\) given that \\( A \\) has occurred.\n",
    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability of event \\( A \\).\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the prior probability of event \\( B \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How is Bayes' Theorem Used in Practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is used in various practical applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Medical Diagnosis**: To update the probability of a disease given test results. For example, if a patient tests positive for a disease, Bayes' theorem can help calculate the probability that the patient actually has the disease, considering the test's accuracy and the disease's prevalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spam Filtering**: In email systems, Bayes' theorem is used to classify emails as spam or not spam based on the presence of certain keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Risk Assessment**: In finance and insurance, Bayes' theorem helps in assessing the risk of events based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Machine Learning**: In classification problems, such as Naive Bayes classifiers, Bayes' theorem is used to predict the probability of classes given the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is the Relationship Between Bayes' Theorem and Conditional Probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem directly involves conditional probability. It provides a way to compute the conditional probability \\( P(A|B) \\) â€” the probability of event \\( A \\) occurring given that \\( B \\) has occurred. The theorem updates our prior beliefs about \\( A \\) (represented by \\( P(A) \\)) in light of new evidence \\( B \\) (represented by \\( P(B|A) \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. How Do You Choose Which Type of Naive Bayes Classifier to Use for Any Given Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of Naive Bayes classifier depends on the type of features in your dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Use this when features are continuous and assumed to be normally distributed. It estimates the likelihood of the features given the class using Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Suitable for discrete features, especially in text classification where features represent counts or frequencies (e.g., word counts in emails).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Used for binary/boolean features, where the features are binary (e.g., presence or absence of words).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the dataset:\n",
