    "Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "The Wrapper and Filter methods are two distinct approaches to feature selection in machine learning, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Here's a comparison of the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrapper Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "   - The Wrapper method evaluates subsets of features by actually training and testing a model on them. It uses the performance of the model as a criterion to select features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process**:\n",
    "   - Subset Selection: Different subsets of features are selected.\n",
    "   - Model Training: A model is trained on each subset.\n",
    "   - Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using a specific metric (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\n",
    "   - Best Subset: The subset that yields the best performance is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantages**:\n",
    "   - Takes into account feature dependencies: Since it evaluates features in the context of the chosen model, it can capture interactions between features.\n",
    "   - Generally leads to better performance: Because it is tailored to the specific model and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "   - Computationally expensive: Training and evaluating the model multiple times can be very time-consuming, especially with large datasets and complex models.\n",
    "   - Risk of overfitting: Since it optimizes feature selection for the specific dataset, it may overfit if not properly validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "   - The Filter method evaluates the relevance of each feature independently of any machine learning algorithm. It uses statistical techniques to rank features based on their relationship with the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process**:\n",
    "   - Statistical Criteria: Features are evaluated using metrics like correlation coefficients, mutual information, chi-square tests, etc.\n",
    "   - Ranking: Features are ranked according to their scores.\n",
    "   - Selection: A threshold or top-k features are selected based on the ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantages**:\n",
    "   - Computationally efficient: It doesn't require training a model, making it faster and more scalable to large datasets.\n",
    "   - Less risk of overfitting: As it doesn't involve the model in the selection process, it is less likely to overfit to the specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "   - Ignores feature dependencies: Evaluates each feature independently, which might miss interactions between features.\n",
    "   - Generally less accurate: Might not perform as well as wrapper methods because it doesn't consider the specific model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrapper Method**: Uses model performance to evaluate feature subsets, capturing feature interactions but at a higher computational cost and risk of overfitting.\n",
    "- **Filter Method**: Uses statistical measures to independently evaluate features, offering computational efficiency and simplicity but potentially overlooking feature interactions and model-specific performance."

    "Embedded feature selection methods incorporate feature selection directly into the model training process. Some common techniques used in embedded feature selection methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)**:\n",
    "   - Adds an L1 regularization term to the loss function, which can shrink some feature coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a subset of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ridge Regression**:\n",
    "   - Adds an L2 regularization term to the loss function, which penalizes large coefficients, helping to select more relevant features, although it doesn't set coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Net**:\n",
    "   - Combines L1 and L2 regularization, balancing between Lasso and Ridge Regression, promoting sparsity while considering correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decision Trees and Random Forests**:\n",
    "   - Decision trees inherently perform feature selection by choosing the most informative features at each split. Random forests, which aggregate multiple decision trees, can provide feature importance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)**:\n",
    "   - Similar to decision trees, GBMs build an ensemble of trees, and feature importance can be derived based on their contribution to the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Regularized Regression Models**:\n",
    "   - Models like Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net, where regularization terms help in selecting significant features by penalizing less important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**:\n",
    "   - RFE recursively removes the least important features based on the weights assigned by the SVM, refining the feature set iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques ensure that feature selection is performed as part of the model fitting process, improving model performance and interpretability."
