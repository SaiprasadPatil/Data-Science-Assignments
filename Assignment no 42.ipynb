    "### Q1. Difference Between Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Linear Regression:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** A statistical method to model the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor) and a dependent variable (response) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.\n",
    "- **Model Equation:** \\( y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon \\)\n",
    "  - Where \\( y \\) is the dependent variable, \\( x \\) is the independent variable, \\( \\beta_0 \\) is the intercept, \\( \\beta_1 \\) is the slope, and \\( \\epsilon \\) is the error term.\n",
    "- **Example:** Predicting a person's weight (\\( y \\)) based on their height (\\( x \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Linear Regression:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** A statistical method to model the relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.\n",
    "- **Model Equation:** \\( y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x_n + \\epsilon \\)\n",
    "  - Where \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) are the independent variables.\n",
    "- **Example:** Predicting a person’s weight (\\( y \\)) based on height (\\( x_1 \\)), age (\\( x_2 \\)), and gender (\\( x_3 \\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "1. **Linearity:** The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence:** Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity:** The residuals (errors) have constant variance at each level of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "4. **Normality:** The residuals of the model are normally distributed.\n",
    "5. **No Multicollinearity:** Independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checking Assumptions:**\n",
    "1. **Linearity:** Use scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the predictors and the response variable.\n",
    "2. **Independence:** Use the Durbin-Watson test or plot residuals over time.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity:** Plot residuals vs. fitted values; look for constant spread.\n",
    "4. **Normality:** Use a Q-Q plot or perform a Shapiro-Wilk test on residuals.\n",
    "5. **No Multicollinearity:** Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or correlation matrix among predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Interpreting the Slope and Intercept in a Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\))**: The value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. It’s the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\n",
    "- **Slope (\\(\\beta_1\\))**: The change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. It indicates the steepness and direction of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- **Scenario:** Predicting house prices based on square footage.\n",
    "- **Model:** \\( \\text{Price} = 50,000 + 200 \\times \\text{Square Footage} \\)\n",
    "  - **Intercept:** \\$50,000 (estimated base price of the house).\n",
    "  - **Slope:** \\$200 (each additional square foot increases the price by \\$200).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Concept of Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Descent:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** An optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function (error) of a model by iteratively adjusting the model parameters (weights) in the direction of the steepest descent.\n",
    "- **How It Works:** \n",
    "  - Start with initial guesses for the parameters.\n",
    "  - Compute the gradient (partial derivatives) of the cost function with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "  - Update the parameters by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "  - Repeat until convergence (when the cost function no longer significantly decreases).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in Machine Learning:**\n",
    "- Gradient descent is commonly used to train machine learning models, particularly in linear regression and neural networks, to find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Multiple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Extends simple linear regression by using multiple independent variables to predict a dependent variable.\n",
    "- **Model Equation:** \\( y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x_n + \\epsilon \\)\n",
    "  - Allows for the inclusion of various predictors simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference from Simple Linear Regression:**\n",
    "- **Simple Linear Regression:** Involves one independent variable.\n",
    "- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Involves multiple independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Concept of Multicollinearity in Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Occurs when two or more independent variables in a multiple linear regression model are highly correlated, leading to unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "- **Detection:**\n",
    "  - **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** A high VIF (>10) indicates multicollinearity.\n",
    "  - **Correlation Matrix:** High correlations between predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Addressing Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "- **Remove Highly Correlated Variables:** Eliminate one of the correlated variables.\n",
    "- **Combine Variables:** Use dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Apply techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression to reduce the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Polynomial Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polynomial Regression:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** An extension of linear regression that models the relationship between the independent and dependent variables as an \\(n\\)-th degree polynomial.\n",
    "- **Model Equation:** \\( y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x^n + \\epsilon \\)\n",
    "  - Allows for fitting non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference from Linear Regression:**\n",
    "- **Linear Regression:** Models a straight-line relationship.\n",
    "- **Polynomial Regression:** Models a curved relationship by including higher-degree terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Advantages and Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Captures Non-Linearity:** Can model complex relationships between variables.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Fits a wide range of data patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** Higher-degree polynomials can fit noise in the data, leading to overfitting.\n",
    "- **Increased Complexity:** More parameters can make the model harder to interpret and computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Polynomial Regression:**\n",
    "- **When Data Shows Non-Linear Trends:** If a scatter plot of the data suggests a non-linear relationship.\n",
    "- **When Linear Regression Fails to Fit:** When a linear model is insufficient to capture the complexity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Case:**\n",
    "- Modeling the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales where the effect of temperature on sales is not linear. \n",
